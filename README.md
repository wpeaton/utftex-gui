# utftex-gui
GUI for UTFTeX. Done in Python using PySide6. Can easily be adapted to PyQt6 with changes to `import` statements.

[UTFTeX](https://github.com/bartp5/libtexprintf) is a very nice command line program that produces beautiful output. But sometimes I like a GUI. So I made one with ideas ripped off from the original AsciiTeX.

My use case is that I often want to put pretty equations in my source code to document the formulas I'm trying to implement.
